# Improved Version Handling Logic

## Changes Made

### ✅ **CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)**
- **Removed** pre-release suffix logic from CI
- **Always uses** base version from `version.json`
- **Purpose**: CI should only validate, not modify versions

### ✅ **Manual Deployment Workflows**
- **Added** pre-release suffix logic to:
  - `deploy-docs.yml` (Manual docs deployment)
  - `deploy-nuget.yml` (Manual NuGet deployment)
- **Changed** suffix from "alpha" to "beta"
- **Logic**: Only adds suffix when NOT on main branch

### ✅ **Main Deployment Workflow (`main.yml`)**
- **Always uses** base version (no suffix logic needed)
- **Reason**: Only runs on main branch, so always production version

## New Version Logic

### Base Version (from version.json)
```json
{
    "version": "4.0.1"
}
```

### Version Resolution by Workflow

| Workflow | Branch | Resulting Version | Example |
|----------|---------|------------------|---------|
| `ci.yml` | Any | Base version | `4.0.1` |
| `main.yml` | main | Base version | `4.0.1` |
| `deploy-docs.yml` | main | Base version | `4.0.1` |
| `deploy-docs.yml` | feature | Base + beta suffix | `4.0.1-beta.abc1234` |
| `deploy-nuget.yml` | main | Base version | `4.0.1` |
| `deploy-nuget.yml` | feature | Base + beta suffix | `4.0.1-beta.abc1234` |

## Benefits

### 1. **Cleaner CI**
- CI doesn't modify versions
- Just validates and builds with base version
- Easier to debug

### 2. **Better Deployment Control**
- Manual deployments decide their own versioning
- Can deploy from any branch with appropriate versioning
- Beta suffix for non-main branches

### 3. **Consistent Main Branch**
- Main branch always uses exact version from version.json
- No confusion about production versions

### 4. **Semantic Versioning Compliance**
- Production: `4.0.1`
- Pre-release: `4.0.1-beta.abc1234`
- Follows semantic versioning standards

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: CI on PR Branch
```bash
# version.json contains: "4.0.1"
# CI workflow runs
# Result: All files use "4.0.1" (no suffix)
```

### Scenario 2: Manual Docs Deploy from Feature Branch
```bash
# version.json contains: "4.0.1"
# deploy-docs.yml runs on feature branch
# Result: Docs deployed with "4.0.1-beta.abc1234"
```

### Scenario 3: Auto Deploy on Main
```bash
# version.json contains: "4.0.1"
# main.yml runs on main branch
# Result: Both docs and NuGet deployed with "4.0.1"
```

## Why This is Better

1. **Separation of Concerns**: CI validates, deployments version
2. **Flexibility**: Can deploy from any branch with appropriate versioning
3. **Predictability**: Main branch always uses exact version
4. **Semantic Versioning**: Proper use of pre-release identifiers
5. **Debugging**: Easier to trace version issues

The version logic is now properly distributed across workflows based on their purpose!
