# Workflow Efficiency Fix

## Problem Identified
Both `ci.yml` and `main.yml` were running on push to main branch, causing:
- **Redundant builds** - Same code built twice
- **Wasted CI resources** - Double the compute time
- **Unnecessary complexity** - Two workflows doing similar work

## Before Fix
```yaml
# ci.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]      # ❌ Running on main
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# main.yml  
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]      # ❌ Also running on main
```

**Result**: Push to main → Both workflows run → Inefficient

## After Fix
```yaml
# ci.yml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]      # ✅ Only PRs
  workflow_dispatch:

# main.yml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]      # ✅ Only main pushes
  workflow_dispatch:
```

**Result**: Push to main → Only main.yml runs → Efficient

## New Workflow Logic

### PR Created/Updated
- **`ci.yml`** runs: Build validation, version check
- **`validate-version.yml`** runs: Version validation
- **No deployment** occurs

### Main Branch Push (PR Merged)
- **`main.yml`** runs: Build, pack, deploy both docs and NuGet
- **`ci.yml`** does NOT run (no duplication)

### Manual Deployment
- **`deploy-docs.yml`** or **`deploy-nuget.yml`** can be run manually
- Independent of other workflows

## Efficiency Gains

| Scenario | Before | After | Savings |
|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| PR creation | 2 workflows | 2 workflows | No change |
| Main branch push | 2 workflows | 1 workflow | **50% reduction** |
| Manual deployment | N/A | 1 workflow | New capability |

## Benefits

1. **Faster main branch deployments** - Only one workflow runs
2. **Reduced CI costs** - Half the compute time on main pushes
3. **Clearer separation** - CI validates, main deploys
4. **Less log noise** - Easier to debug when issues occur
5. **Resource efficiency** - No duplicate builds

## Workflow Responsibilities

| Workflow | Purpose | Triggers |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `ci.yml` | **Validation only** | PRs, manual |
| `main.yml` | **Production deployment** | Main pushes, manual |
| `deploy-docs.yml` | **Manual docs deploy** | Manual only |
| `deploy-nuget.yml` | **Manual NuGet deploy** | Manual only |
| `validate-version.yml` | **Version validation** | PRs, manual |

This fix eliminates redundancy while maintaining all functionality - much more efficient!
